This project utilizes Kaggle Dataset of over 14k images of Oregon Wildlife. I used this data to build and test three neural networks to categorize photos into their proper categories. One model was a basic Convolutional Neural Network working with two classes. The second model used Inception v3 to classify two classes, and the last used Inception v3 again on the complete dataset of 20 classes.
