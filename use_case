This wildlife classification project will allow pictures of common, large animals from the state of Oregon to be automatically identified from photos. Conservation organizations as well as the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife may use this system to classify images captured by game cameras, hunters, and wildlife enthusiasts to assess wildlife populations within the state.
